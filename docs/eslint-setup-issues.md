# ESLint Setup Issues Documentation

## Current Issues

### 1. Module Resolution Errors
- Persistent error with `ajv` module resolution
- Error message: `Cannot find module '[path]\ajv\lib\compile\resolve.js'`
- This appears to be a dependency resolution issue in the monorepo structure

### 2. Package Management Challenges
- Issues with installing dependencies at root level
- Permission errors when trying to modify `node_modules`
- Conflicts between workspace-level and package-level dependencies

### 3. Configuration Complexity
- Attempted multiple configuration approaches:
  - Flat config (eslint.config.js)
  - Traditional config (.eslintrc.js)
  - Package-specific configs
  - Various plugin combinations (typescript-eslint, standard, prettier)

### 4. Current State
- TypeScript type checking is working correctly
- Successfully removed `any` types from the codebase
- Improved type safety in database operations
- ESLint integration pending resolution

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Root Level Configuration**
   - Tried flat configuration with `eslint.config.js`
   - Attempted traditional configuration with `.eslintrc.js`
   - Added necessary TypeScript ESLint plugins and configs

2. **Package Level Configuration**
   - Created package-specific ESLint configs
   - Attempted to run ESLint directly in package directories
   - Modified package.json scripts for local ESLint execution

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Cleaned up conflicting dependencies
   - Attempted to reinstall with clean node_modules
   - Tried various ESLint plugin combinations

## Recommendations for Future Resolution

1. **Short-term Solutions**
   - Continue using TypeScript's built-in type checking
   - Use `tsc` for static analysis
   - Rely on IDE-based linting temporarily

2. **Investigation Points**
   - Check for version conflicts in package dependencies
   - Verify monorepo workspace configuration
   - Investigate `ajv` module resolution issue
   - Consider alternative tools like Rome or Biome

3. **Next Steps**
   - Set up a fresh ESLint configuration in a new branch
   - Test ESLint setup in isolation
   - Consider upgrading/downgrading key dependencies
   - Document successful configuration when achieved
