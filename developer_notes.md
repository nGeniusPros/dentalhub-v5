# API Implementation Progress and Issues

## Current Progress

-   **Core Infrastructure:**
    -   Monorepo structure with separate packages for frontend, API gateway, core utilities, database, and services.
    -   Shared TypeScript configurations are set up for all packages.
    -   Environment variables are loaded from a root `.env` file.
    -   Supabase client is configured and ready for use.
    -   The `campaigns` table has been created in the Supabase database using the provided SQL migration.
-   **Communication Service:**
    -   `RetellService` is implemented for initiating calls, managing WebSocket connections, retrieving recordings, and updating call configurations.
    -   `CampaignService` is implemented for creating, updating, retrieving, listing, and deleting campaigns.
    -   API routes for campaign management are set up.
    -   API endpoints for initiating voice calls, retrieving recordings, and updating call configurations are implemented.
    -   A webhook endpoint for handling Retell events is set up.
    -   The communication service is structured with separate directories for services, types, and routes.
-   **API Gateway:**
    -   Basic Express server setup with middleware (CORS, helmet, rate limiting).
    -   API Gateway is ready to be integrated with the communication service.
    -   Middleware for dependency injection, error handling, and request logging is implemented.
    -   API routes for campaigns, communication, and webhooks are set up.
-   **Git Setup:**
    -   Git repository initialized.
    -   README.md added and committed.
    -   Main branch created.
    -   Remote origin added.
    -   Changes pushed to the remote repository.

## Current Issues

-   **API Gateway Build Errors:**
    -   The API gateway is currently encountering errors when trying to import the database module.
    -   Specifically, the following error is present in `apps/api/src/routes/campaigns.ts`:
        ```
        src/routes/campaigns.ts:4:34 - error TS2307: Cannot find module '@dentalhub/database/src' or its corresponding type declarations.
        ```
    -   Additionally, the following type errors are present in the same file:
        ```
        src/routes/campaigns.ts:9:33 - error TS2347: Untyped function calls may not accept type arguments.
        src/routes/campaigns.ts:19:33 - error TS2347: Untyped function calls may not accept type arguments.
        src/routes/campaigns.ts:30:33 - error TS2347: Untyped function calls may not accept type arguments.
        ```
    -   These errors indicate that the API gateway is unable to locate the database module, specifically the types, and that the type arguments in the supabase calls are not being recognized.
    -   The tsconfig.json in the api package has been updated to include the correct paths, but the issue persists.
    -   The database package has been built successfully, but the API package still fails to build.
    -   The core package has been built successfully.

## Next Steps

-   Investigate the module resolution issue in the API gateway.
-   Fix the type errors in the API routes.
-   Implement the patient service.
-   Implement additional services (insurance, AI).
-   Implement authentication and authorization.
-   Implement error handling and logging.
-   Implement testing for all services.
